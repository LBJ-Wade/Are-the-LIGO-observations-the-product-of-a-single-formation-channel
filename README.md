# Are-the-LIGO-observations-the-product-of-a-single-formation-channel
A Mathematica notebook for calculating the probability that all of the first n binary black hole events observed LIGO come from the same formation channel (e.g. dynamical formation in a dense stellar environment or formation from field binaries). These calculations are statistical in nature and do not rely on the details of the measured source parameters (e.g. masses and spins). The calculations do depend on several prior assumptions about the formation channels operating. We provide this notebook to enable users to easily explore the effect of varying these assumptions.

The Mathematica notebook in this repository was created using Mathematica version 10.0.2.0.
