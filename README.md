# Are the LIGO observations the product of a single formation channel?

A Mathematica notebook for calculating the probability that all of the first _n_ binary black hole events observed by LIGO and Virgo come from the same formation channel (e.g., dynamical formation in a dense stellar environment or formation from field binaries). These calculations are statistical in nature and do not consider the measured source parameters (e.g., masses and spins) of the actual events. The calculations depend on several prior assumptions about the formation channels operating; this notebook allows the easy exploration of the effect of varying these assumptions.

The Mathematica notebook in this repository was created using [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) version 10.0.2.0.
